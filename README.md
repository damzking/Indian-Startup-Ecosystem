# Indian Startup Ecosystem : Funding Trends 2018-2021 <a name="about-project"></a>

## Overview 

India's startup ecosystem has experienced rapid growth, adding over 16,000 new tech companies in 2020. Despite funding challenges, Indian startups secured $8.4 billion in funding in 2023, showcasing investor confidence. The ecosystem boasts 99,000 startups and 108 unicorns valued at $340.80 billion, ranking third globally.

Key drivers of this growth include government support, access to capital, a robust talent pool, and a supportive entrepreneurial culture. India's focus on fostering entrepreneurship has been instrumental in its rise as a major player in the global startup landscape, with Silicon Valley maintaining its top position.

## Data Sources 📊
- The dataset is provided in CSV format for transparency and reproducibility.
- Statistics on Indian startup funding from 2018 to 2021.

## Topical Questions and Hypotheses
#### Questions 🤔:

- What was the average funding amount in 2018 compared to 2019?
- What was the average funding amount in 2020 compared to 2021?
- How has the funding trend evolved from 2018 to 2021?
- Which startup received the highest average funding?
- What are the top 10 cities with the highest number of start-ups?
- What are the top 10 cities that attract the most start-up funding?
- What are the top 10 sectors attracting the most start-up funding?
- How has the funding trend been for different sectors over the years?
- Which stage is predominant among start-ups?
- Which startup stage received the most funding?
- How has the funding trend evolved for different stages over the years?

### Hypotheses 🔬:
#### A significance level (α) of 5% will used to perform all the hypothesis testing

- Bengaluru's start-ups receive funding equal to or greater than those in New Delhi.
- Fintech companies receive funding exceeding or equal to the average funding.
- The funding received in 2020 is no greater than the funding in 2021.
- Funding received in 2018 equals or exceeds that of 2019.
- Companies aged 5 years or more receive funding equal to or less than the average amount.
- Companies that are 10 years and above do not receive more than average amount of Funding.
- There is no significant difference between the sample mean and population mean for the average amount of funding received in Bengaluru.
- There is no significant difference in the average funding received for bengaluru and Mumbai in the year 2020.
